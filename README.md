# Task 9: Random Forest – Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objective
To detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forest and compare its performance with a baseline model.

## Dataset
- Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Joblib

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset and analyzed class imbalance
2. Separated features and target variable
3. Performed stratified train-test split
4. Built baseline Logistic Regression model
5. Trained Random Forest model
6. Evaluated models using Precision, Recall, and F1-score
7. Plotted feature importance
8. Saved trained Random Forest model

## Result
Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in detecting fraudulent transactions, especially in recall and F1-score.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates ensemble learning and effective handling of imbalanced datasets in fraud detection.
